Joseph Salter (9 April 1822 – 3 March 1899) was a Christian missionary in London who worked with migrants to the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century. He was particularly known for his work with lascars and later for his work with ayahs. He taught himself several Indian languages and wrote two books describing his work.
